For phase 1:

To run the code, you can simply download the whole archive, open the folder in any code editor and get starting with running the ipynb files. All the necessary files and data has been place in the same directory, hence no need of relative paths for importing csv data files. The repository also contains requirements.csv file for installing the necessary libraries.

For phase 2:

All the files in for the phase 2 submission are contained in the folder 'Phase2_submission'. To access and run the code, place all the files in some folder, also place the 3 folders of the dataset (submitted through a drive folder link) in the same directory as the codes since the relative paths are used to import data files in the code. Thank you.
